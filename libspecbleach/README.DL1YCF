libspecbleach
=============

The material put here into piHPSDR comes from

https://github.com/lucianodato/libspecbleach

A Makefile has been provided that just compiles the files needed
in piHPSDR and produce a library that can be linked statically.

This means, compared to the original repository, only the files

libspecbleach/Makefile
libspecbleach/README     (this file)

have been added and lots of files omitted (e.g. tests, examples,
meson build files, etc.)
